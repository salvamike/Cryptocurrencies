# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview 
In this module challenge, I used unsupervised learning to process data, cluster, reduce dimensions, and to reduce the principal components using PCA. This analysis is pulled for clients who are getting ready to get into the cryptocurrency market. Because there is no known output for what we are looking for, we are using unsupervised learning. I used a clustering algorithm to group the cryptocurrencies.
## Purpose
Martha is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, one of my most important clients. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
